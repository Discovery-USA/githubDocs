STEPS TO DEPLOY
- Find Repo on GitHub
- Create a branch off of Master
- Clone branch to your desktop
- Develop locally and commit often
- When "finished" deploy to dev to check changes
- When it looks good sync the branch and notify Interactive Project Manager/Colin
- Code will be reviewed and any issues with Master addressed
- Once routed and all changes have been made to this branch, merge with Master
- Push files via FTP to production server
- Save current version to Interactive Jobs

OPEN QUESTIONS
- How can we combine the pushing of code to Master with actual deployment to prod server? I know it's easily done via command line. But it looks like using the GUI we need an additional layer of service/cron job to do this. See here: http://css-tricks.com/deployment/

- Do we really want to make devs save to our Interactive Server after each push? 

- Is it right to use the dev server as a place to check the changes on a branch? Or should this be done locally? Not sure if all devs have what they need to run IIS or PHP locally. I know it's not hard, but just sayin'.
